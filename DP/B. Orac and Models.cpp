// There are n models in the shop numbered from 1 to n, with sizes s1,s2,â€¦,sn.

// Orac will buy some of the models and will arrange them in the order of increasing numbers (i.e. indices, but not sizes).

// Orac thinks that the obtained arrangement is beatiful, if for any two adjacent models with indices ij and ij+1 (note that ij<ij+1, because Orac arranged them properly), ij+1 is divisible by ij and sij<sij+1.

// For example, for 6 models with sizes {3,6,7,7,7,7}, he can buy models with indices 1, 2, and 6, and the obtained arrangement will be beautiful. Also, note that the arrangement with exactly one model is also considered beautiful.

// Orac wants to know the maximum number of models that he can buy, and he may ask you these queries many times.
